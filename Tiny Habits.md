**Don't quit the task until it's finished.**

**Make the Cue Invisible:**
- Remove visual triggers: Eliminate visual cues that prompt task continuation.

**Make the Process Unattractive:**
- Break tasks into smaller steps: Divide tasks into less enjoyable sub-steps, reducing the overall appeal of the process.
